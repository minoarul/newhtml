1.  Important Tags in HTML?
<html> â€“ Root tag of an HTML document.

<head> â€“ Contains metadata like title, CSS, scripts.

<title> â€“ Sets the page title (shown on browser tab).

<body> â€“ Defines the main content of the page.

<h1> â€¦ <h6> â€“ Heading tags (h1 = largest, h6 = smallest).

<p> â€“ Paragraph tag for text.

<a> â€“ Anchor tag for hyperlinks.

<img> â€“ Displays images.

<br> â€“ Inserts a line break.

<hr> â€“ Inserts a horizontal line.
2 .Why not put all content inside <head>?
The reason is:

<head> tag â†’ It is only for metadata (information about the webpage, not visible to users). Example: title, description, styles, scripts.

<body> tag â†’ It is for the actual content that should be displayed on the webpage (text, images, videos, links).

ðŸ‘‰ If we put all content inside <head>, the browser will not show it because the head is not meant for visible content.
Thatâ€™s why we always keep page content in <body> and page information in <head>.
